# Code Review

## Context Recovery
Before starting any review: `git log --oneline <base-branch>..<branch>`

## Review Model
You are reviewing work tracked in PLAN.md and progress.json.

Review scope covers all phases from Phase 1 through the current phase -- not just the latest diff. Code written in earlier phases may have regressed or been invalidated by later changes.

## On each review

1. Run `git log --oneline -- feedback.md` then `git show <sha>` on prior versions to understand previous findings and how the doer addressed them. Incorporate the doer's responses into your review notes so the full picture is captured in the new write-up.
2. Read progress.json -- identify which tasks are marked completed since last review
3. Read PLAN.md, requirements.md, and any design docs in the work folder -- verify code aligns with requirements intent, not just plan mechanics
4. `git diff` the relevant commits against the base branch
5. Check each completed task against its "done" criteria in PLAN.md
6. Run the project build step and linter check first, then run ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e). All of them must pass -- if any fail, CHANGES NEEDED.
7. Verify CI passes for the latest push -- if CI is red, CHANGES NEEDED regardless of code quality
8. Check for regressions in previously approved phases

## What to check

- Does the code match what PLAN.md specified?
- Does the code solve what requirements.md asked for?
- Do tests pass? Are new tests added for new behavior?
- Test quality: flag overlapping/redundant tests that add no value. Flag untested exposed surfaces (public APIs, error paths, edge cases). Phase does not close until test coverage is meaningful, not just present
- Are there security issues (injection, auth bypass, secrets in code)?
- Is the code consistent with existing patterns and conventions?
- Are docs updated if behavior changed?
- Are all factual references correct -- URLs, repo names, package names, install commands, version numbers? Members hallucinate these; spot-check against known sources.
- **File hygiene:** Run `git diff --name-only <base-branch>..<branch>`. For every file added, modified, or deleted -- you must be able to justify it against the sprint requirements. If you cannot, flag CHANGES NEEDED. Common unjustifiable patterns:
  - Temp/scratch: `*.tmp`, `*.txt`, `*.base64`
  - Tool/security configs: `.gemini/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `permissions.json`
  - Unrelated scripts or stale artifacts: `plan-NNN.md`, `requirements-NNN.md`, `progress-NNN.json`
  - Tracked agent context: `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `COPILOT.md`, `AGY.md` (ensure gitignored)

  Permit only source, tests, and active sprint tracking (`PLAN.md`, `progress.json`, `requirements.md`, `feedback.md`, design docs). When in doubt, flag it.

## Output

Overwrite feedback.md with this structure:

```
# <sprint-name> -- Code Review

**Reviewer:** <your-member-name>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+TZ
**Verdict:** APPROVED | CHANGES NEEDED

> See the recent git history of this file to understand the context of this review.

---

## <Review section>

<Detailed narrative. PASS/FAIL/NOTE inline. Explain what you found, where, and why it matters.>

---

## Summary

<Synthesize what passed, what must change, what is deferred.>
```

If verdict is CHANGES NEEDED: the doer annotates each relevant section with `**Doer:** fixed in commit <sha> -- <what changed>` before requesting re-review.

Commit feedback.md and push.

## Rules
- NEVER push to the base branch (main, master, or integration branch) -- always work on feature branches
- NEVER commit this agent context file (CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / AGENTS.md / COPILOT.md / AGY.md) -- it is role-specific and not shared

# Plan Generation

You are generating an implementation plan. Read requirements.md for what needs to be built.

### PHASE 0 -- EXPLORE (before writing any plan)

1. Read relevant source files for this task
2. Read existing tests -- understand conventions and framework
3. `git log --oneline -20` -- recent changes in the area
4. List assumptions about how the code works
5. For every assumption you listed, answer: "How do I know this is currently true?" Then verify it.
   Two categories to check:
   - **Existence:** Does the thing you are building on top of actually exist right now? (e.g. a named entity, interface, resource, capability, configuration, or path your plan depends on)
   - **Accessibility:** Can the part of the system that needs it actually reach it? (e.g. is it exposed, connected, permitted, or in scope for the component that will use it)
   If you cannot verify an assumption, it becomes a risk register entry, not a task precondition.
6. Report: what you found, what patterns exist, what constraints matter

### PHASE 1 -- DRAFT

For each task include:
- What file(s) to create or change
- What the change does -- specific, not vague ("add X method to Y class" not "implement feature")
- What "done" means -- test passes, output appears, API returns expected response
- What could block -- missing dependency, unclear API, native code issue

Rules:
- **Phase boundaries by cohesion, not count** -- a phase is a coherent unit of work that produces a reviewable, testable increment. Group tasks into a phase when they share a data model, code path, or design decision -- splitting them would produce an incoherent intermediate state or require touching the same code twice. Place a VERIFY at the natural completion boundary of that unit, not at an arbitrary task count. Phases may have 4-5 tasks (a coherent subsystem) or just 1-2 (a genuinely isolated change).
- Each task completable in one session, results in one commit
- Tasks ordered so dependencies are satisfied
- **Model tier assignment:** Assign a tier (`cheap`, `standard`, or `premium`) to every work task based on complexity:
  - `cheap` -- mechanical changes with no ambiguity (rename, move, simple config edit)
  - `standard` -- typical implementation work (new function, test suite, moderate refactor)
  - `premium` -- high-ambiguity design tasks, architectural decisions, or tasks requiring deep multi-file reasoning
  - Write the tier into the task entry in PLAN.md (e.g. `- **Tier:** standard`)
  - When the PM creates progress.json from the plan, it copies each task's tier into `tasks[i].tier`
  - During dispatch, the PM reads `tasks[i].tier` and passes `model: <tier>` to `execute_prompt` for doer dispatches
  - **Constraint:** Reviewer dispatches always use `model: premium` regardless of the task tier -- this is not configurable by the planner
- **The plan is the elaboration, not the summary:** requirements.md uses terse human language with intentional ambiguity. PLAN.md must resolve that ambiguity -- every edge case decided, every behaviour specified, every acceptance criterion precise enough that two developers would implement the same thing. Referencing requirements.md for background is fine; deferring a decision to it is not.
- **Monotonically non-decreasing tiers within a phase:** Within a phase, order tasks cheap -> standard -> premium. The PM resumes the same session across tasks in a phase -- a premium task can build a large context that a cheap model cannot load. The PM may group consecutive same-tier tasks into a single dispatch streak; tier transitions trigger a new dispatch. If a dependency forces a higher-tier task before a lower-tier task within a phase, split the phase at that boundary. Cross-phase tier order does not matter -- each phase starts a fresh session.
  ```
  cheap -> cheap -> standard -> standard -> premium -> VERIFY  [VALID]
  cheap -> standard -> cheap -> VERIFY  [INVALID]  (downgrade within phase -- split into two phases)
  ```

### PHASE 2 -- FRONT-LOAD FOUNDATIONS

Two things go first:
1. Key abstractions and shared interfaces -- later tasks build on these. If the foundation is wrong, everything above it is wasted.
2. Riskiest assumption -- the thing that, if it doesn't work, invalidates everything else.

Later tasks MUST follow DRY -- reuse the abstractions from early tasks, never reinvent. If two tasks duplicate logic, the plan is sliced wrong.

Examples: "Does the native addon run a pipeline?" -- Task 1, not Task 15. "Define the shared auth interface" -- Task 1, not scattered across 5 tasks.

### PHASE 3 -- SELF-CRITIQUE

Golden rule: high cohesion within each task, low coupling between tasks. If a task needs the whole project to make sense, it's sliced wrong.

Check your draft against these failure modes:
- Low cohesion -- does this task touch unrelated areas? Split by component boundary.
- High coupling -- does task N depend heavily on task M's internals? Decouple via interfaces.
- Vague task -- could two developers interpret this differently?
- Too large -- more than ~50 tool calls? Split it.
- Hidden dependency -- does task N assume something from task M that isn't explicit?
- Late verification -- 5+ tasks before checking if the approach works?
- Wrong ordering -- could the riskiest assumption be validated earlier?
- Missing "done" criteria -- how does the member know the task is complete?
- Phase boundary at wrong place -- does this phase mix unrelated subsystems that could be reviewed independently? Or does it split a cohesive unit across two phases?
- Untracked work -- re-read every task description, note, and comment in your draft. Does any sentence say "X will also need to change", "X must be updated", or "X is a prerequisite"? If yes and there is no task that does that work, either add the task or explicitly state it is out of scope.
- Missing blocker -- does this task depend on anything that another task produces or puts in place? If yes, that task must be listed in Blockers, even if the phase order implies it.
- Tier downgrade within a phase -- does any task have a lower tier than the task before it in the same phase? If yes, either reorder (if dependencies allow) or split the phase at the downgrade point. Cross-phase tier order does not matter -- each phase starts with a fresh session.

### PHASE 4 -- REFINE

Rewrite incorporating critique:
- Move risky/uncertain tasks earlier
- Split vague tasks into specific ones
- VERIFY checkpoint at the natural completion boundary of each cohesive phase
- Every task has clear "done" criteria

### PHASE 5 -- BRANCH & COMMIT

1. Read requirements.md for the base branch (default: `main`)
2. `git fetch origin && git checkout -b <feature-branch> origin/<base-branch>`
3. Commit the plan files to the feature branch -- NEVER commit to the base branch
4. `git push -u origin <feature-branch>`

Output the final plan in PLAN.md format.

# Simple Sprint

A lightweight flow for small, single-session tasks. Use this when the work is
small enough that a full task harness (PLAN.md, progress.json) is unnecessary
overhead.

## When to use

- 1-3 tasks, completable in a single session
- No complex phasing or cross-phase dependencies
- Low risk, well-understood scope

Use the full sprint lifecycle (sprint.md) for anything larger. If the work turns
out bigger than expected, promote to a full sprint.

## Flow

1. Write a concise requirements.md on the branch and commit.
2. Create a small beads epic + a task per item.
3. Dispatch the doer (model sized to the work) with requirements inline or by
   reference. The doer completes work, commits, and pushes.
   <!-- EXPERIMENT: model override (exp/s1-haiku-doer-sonnet-reviewer) -- dispatch doer on `haiku` -->
4. Dispatch the reviewer (strongest model, fresh session). The reviewer reads
   deliverables + diff, outputs verdict: APPROVED or CHANGES NEEDED.
   <!-- EXPERIMENT: model override (exp/s1-haiku-doer-sonnet-reviewer) -- dispatch reviewer on `sonnet` (overrides "strongest model") -->
5. On APPROVED: close the beads tasks and the delivered source issues, clean
   sprint scaffolding from the PR (see sprint.md Completion step 3 -- git rm
   sprint-created tracking files, restore any the repo already shipped, then
   verify the net diff is product only), commit as pm, raise the PR (or report
   the diff for local-only), remove the worktree.
6. On CHANGES NEEDED: send feedback to doer, re-dispatch, repeat from step 3.
7. Create low-priority beads tasks for any unresolved findings or deferred items.
8. STOP: do not merge. Surface the PR URL and CI status to the user and await
   explicit instruction.

## Rules

- Still requires pre-flight checks (see doer-reviewer-loop.md Pre-flight checks).
- In fleet mode: still requires permissions and doer/reviewer pairing (see
  fleet-addendum.md).
- No progress.json or PLAN.md -- beads + git carry the state.
- Branch naming: choose a name that makes the purpose clear --
  feat/<description>, fix/<description>, chore/<description>.

## Recovery after orchestrator restart

No progress.json -- recovery relies on git history and beads.

1. `bd list --tree <epic-id>` -- what is open, in progress, closed.
2. Per worktree: `git log --oneline -5` -- any commits since last known state?
3. `git status` -- uncommitted changes?

Then act:

- **Work committed, next step clear** -> dispatch reviewer or continue doer.
- **At review checkpoint** -> dispatch reviewer (fresh session).
- **Uncommitted changes of unknown origin** -> escalate to user: "commit and
  resume, or discard?"
- **No progress** -> re-dispatch from scratch.
